Hey! Really loved seeing you guys this weekend.

Quick thoughts on the PM career switch (but we should def chat over the phone):

## On Bootcamps
- BrainStation has a good reputation — can't go wrong for structure
- **But:** Bootcamps teach vocabulary/frameworks, not judgment from doing the work
- Market is flooded with PM bootcamp grads — you need to differentiate
- Treat it as starting point, not finish line

## The Job Market Reality
- Entry-level jobs (PM, dev, design) are brutal right now
- You need to stand out from hundreds making the same switch

## Better Paths

**Option 1: Product-Adjacent Role Where You Are** (lowest-risk)
- Own a business problem at your current company
- Work cross-functionally (sales, ops, support)
- Build internal tools or analyze data to drive decisions
- Demonstrate PM thinking: define problems, propose solutions, get buy-in, measure outcomes
- This IS PM work, even if title isn't "Product Manager"

**Option 2: Be a PM on a Side Project**
- Take free PM course (Reforge, Product School YouTube)
- Pick a real problem and build something
- Don't wait for permission

## The "I Don't Want to Code" Thing

**Good news:** You don't have to write code, but you DO need to be able to build.

**With AI tools, PMs now:**
- Go from idea → working prototype in 30 minutes (not 2 weeks)
- Synthesize 6 interviews in 60 seconds (not 3 hours)
- Research 5 competitors in 30 minutes (not 6 hours)

**Tools:** v0.dev, Lovable, Bolt.new — describe what you want in plain English, get working UI back

## Why This Matters

**Without portfolio:**
"I'm interested in PM and took a bootcamp."

**With portfolio:**
"I identified problem X, built a prototype, talked to 10 users, here's what I learned. Let me show you."

The prototype proves you can define problems, design solutions, and execute.

## 90-Day Plan

**Month 1:** Build AI fluency
- Sign up for Claude.ai or ChatGPT (free)
- Use 30 min/day for work tasks
- Get comfortable prompting

**Month 2:** Learn + Build
- Take lightweight PM course
- Build a prototype with v0.dev
- Talk to 5-10 people about the problem

**Month 3:** Portfolio + Network
- Document your project
- Connect with PMs on LinkedIn
- Share learning publicly

## The Harsh Truth

**Most people break into PM through:**
1. Internal transition (team trusted them)
2. Networking (someone vouched)
3. Built something that got attention

Cold-applying to "Associate PM" rarely works. Resume stack is too high.

## Bottom Line

- Bootcamp? Sure, but not enough alone
- Real advantage: Build working prototypes with AI, show don't tell
- PMs embracing AI tools *now* will dominate in 2-3 years

## Let's Talk

Let me show you this live. Once you see it, "I don't want to code" won't feel like a barrier.

Excited for you. Great time to make this move *if you do it differently.*

**P.S.** Go to v0.dev, describe an app, watch it build in 30 seconds. You'll get it.
