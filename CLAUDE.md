# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a documentation repository for an **AI training workshop for Product Managers** at iQmetrix. It contains workshop materials, demo playbooks, and context documents—no software code.

## Key Files

- `iqmetrix-ai-for-pms.md` — Main workshop document with slides, 11 PM workflow sketches, 4 demo playbooks with speaker scripts, session timing guides
- `iq-ai-pm-prep.md` — Project context export for continuing work: audience profile, decisions made, resources consulted, open questions

## Workshop Context

**Audience:** Non-technical Product Managers at iQmetrix (retail/POS company)

**Goal:** Build AI fluency through personal productivity first, then apply to product evaluation

**Key demos:** Interview Synthesis (voice input), Vibe Coding Prototypes (v0.dev), MCP Artifact Updates (Confluence/Jira), TMForum Standards Automation (capstone)

**Tools covered:** Claude.ai, M365 Copilot, voice input (MacWhisper), v0.dev/Lovable/Bolt for prototyping, Claude Code + MCP for agentic workflows

## When Editing Workshop Content

- Keep language accessible to non-technical PMs
- iQmetrix-specific anchors: RAG Slack bot, Luzmo analytics, TMForum certification effort
- Voice input is positioned as barrier-lowering technique
- MCP integration demonstrates "AI in workflow" vs "AI alongside workflow"
- TMForum automation is the capstone showing "ceiling of what's possible"
